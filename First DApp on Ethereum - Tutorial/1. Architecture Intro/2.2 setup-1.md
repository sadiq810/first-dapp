# DApp with Etherium Smart Contracts - A Tutorial

## Environment Setup 

Here's the stuff we'll need 

- NVM 
- Node 
- Hardhat 
- MetaMask Wallet 

Set up NVM first for 

```bash 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
``` 

Add the environment variables for accesing node commands. 

```bash 
nvm install --lts
```


## Install MetaMask 

MetaMask will manage our wallet so that we can easily view our accounts and test our DApps easily. Go ahead and install MetaMask from `https://metamask.io/`. I'll use Firefox but you can just as well use Chrome. 

(I strongly suggest you use MetaMask for this tutorial so that you can follow along. There's a million wallets out there and it would be difficult to debug issues if you use something other than MetaMask.)

Just go ahead and create an account on MetaMask, set your password and then save the recovery keys as given in the instructions. 


## Setting up Hardhat 

In order to test out our smart contracts, we need an environment that simulates the etherium network locally. We will later try out our smart contract on a global testnet too. 

First, set up a react app that we will use to interact with our environment. 

```bash 
npx create-react-app react-dapp
cd react-dapp 
```

Now go ahead and set up hardhat along with all its dependencies. For now, let's not go into the details of what each part does and what alternatives are available. That would only slow you down and create confusions. It's best to get a hello world done and study options afterwards. 

```bash 
npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle \
            ethereum-waffle chai \
            @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

Let's create basic hardhat configs and setup. 

```bash 
npx hardhat 
```

Accept all defaults. This will create a basic sample project for us. 

We need to edit the hardhat config file so that this works well with MetaMask. ChainId is a unique identifier for the blockchain. 

```bash 
vi hardhat.config.js
```

```javascript 
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  paths: {                         // add this 
    artifacts: './src/artifacts',  // this is where our compiled contracts will go
  },
  networks: {                      // and this ... 
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337                // this is needed for MetaMask
    }
  }
};
```

Start a node using: 

```bash 
npx hardhat node 
``` 

And try to connect to it using MetaMask.
